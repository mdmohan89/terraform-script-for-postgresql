To ensure rollback capability in the Terraform script, we can leverage Terraform's state management features along with version control systems like Git. 

State Management:
Terraform maintains a state file (terraform.tfstate or remote state backend) to track the state of the managed infrastructure.
Before making any changes, Terraform generates an execution plan based on the current state and the desired configuration.
In case of errors or failures during the apply operation, Terraform can automatically roll back changes to the previous known state.
Version Control with Git:
Version control systems like Git allow you to track changes to your Terraform configurations and state files over time.
By committing changes to a version control repository, you can easily revert to a previous state or apply rollbacks when necessary.
Create Git Commits for Infrastructure Changes:
After making changes to your Terraform configuration, commit the changes to your Git repository along with descriptive commit messages.
This ensures that each change to your infrastructure is tracked and can be rolled back if needed.
Use Git Branches for Feature Development:
Create separate branches for different features or changes to your infrastructure.
Before merging changes into the main branch, test them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
Tag Releases for Production Deployments:
Tag releases in your Git repository to mark stable versions of your infrastructure.
This allows you to easily roll back to previous releases in case of issues with newer deployments.
Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and rollback process.
Include tests and validation steps in your pipeline to ensure that changes are safe to deploy.
